<p>How many weeks until thanksgiving in the us? How many days until thanksgiving. Soo many events in the world. Perhaps you�re counting down the days until your wedding day, or you�re wondering how many days there are until university starts or even how long you�ve got to go until you retire. 00 days 00 hours 00 minutes 00 seconds.</p>
