<p>Halloween’s origins can be traced back to the ancient celtic festival known as samhain, which was held on november 1 in contemporary calendars. Each year folk get out their costumes and enjoy all kinds of celebrations and parties. It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead returned to their homes, so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits. The latter’s day was celebrated on november 1. Over time the custom of adults dressing up as demons changed and the children took over.</p>
