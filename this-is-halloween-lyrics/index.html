<p>Tender lumplings everywhere life�s no fun without a good scare that�s our job, but we�re not mean in our town of halloween in this town don�t we love it now? In our town of halloween i am the clown with the tear away face fear of the flash and gobble and trace i am the who in how, who�s there i am the wind blowing through your hair i am the shadow of the moon at night filling your dreams to the brim of fright this is halloween, this is halloween halloween, halloween, halloween, halloween halloween. Oh it�s halloween every night to me is halloween like an ancient scene you know just what i mean halloween you are my pride All the good words have left my mouth / i�m completely out of things to say about it now / more and more, i�ll catalogue my doubts / it�s the worst thing about me and it�s always Helloween lyrics halloween masquerade, masquerade grab your mask and don�t be late get out well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight meet the others at the store knock on other people�s door trick or treat, they have no choice little ghosts are making lots of noise but watch out (watch out)</p>
