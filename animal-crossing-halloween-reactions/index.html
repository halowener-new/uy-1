This update is available on september 30th. And honestly, i can’t handle how good it looks. New skin colors, purchasable halloween costumes, spooky new reactions, and the ability to grow pumpkins (and use them in new diy recipes!).</p>

<p>Following on from the animal crossing: New horizons launched in march, there have been some spooky reactions, which are emotions learned from villagers. Jack, the czar of halloween. I don’t know about you, but this unveiling has got me super hyped for halloween in the game! In addition to the spooky set items, there are two halloween themed reactions you can unlock exclusively during this event giving you new spooky options for expressing yourself in animal crossing!</p>
