<p>Must be logged into your account to clip coupon Halloween 6 is most notable for having a big set of production reshoots, resulting in a fairly confusing and underwhelming film.

<p>This year, we finally get to find out what happened to our halloween explorers in the houses october built 2. Factory announced they�d brokered a deal with anchor bay (and multiple other rights holders) to make the impossible possible: Friday the 13th collection (scream factory boxset) screenshots click each link for the individual film screenshots.
