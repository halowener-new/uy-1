<p>There are ways to get candy without buying it though, but the free method has a bit more work involved. Of course, if you don�t want to. The halloween fall update has brought in tons of new decorations to build, pumpkins to plant, and ways to dress up for this creepy month�s festivities. Each villager will only fall for the disguise once. However, if it hasn’t started yet you should be preparing.</p>

<p>Players can buy additional candy at friends islands, but again are limited to one candy. There are ways to get candy without buying it though, but the free method has a bit more work involved. New horizons halloween candy will be on sale in the cabinet in nook�s cranny for the entirety of october. The first and most reliable way to get candy before halloween night is by visiting friends islands each day. It’s not a great year for your more traditional halloween activities.</p>

<p>The animal crossing new horizons halloween event will officially begin at 5pm on saturday, october 31st and end at midnight. There are ways to get candy without buying it though, but the free method has a bit more work involved. I�m especially looking forward to the halloween activities and meeting jack in person. And tricking villagers by wearing both jack�s face and jack�s robe. Animal crossing new horizon�s halloween event is taking place on the 31st of october from 5:00 pm to 12:00 am.</p>
