<p>Halloween�s answer to the christmas yule log, the ghoul log is: Hubie halloween is a 2020 american comedy horror film directed by steven brill, written by adam sandler and tim herlihy, and starring an ensemble cast consisting of sandler, kevin james, julie bowen, ray liotta, rob schneider, june squibb, kenan thompson, shaquille o�neal, steve buscemi, maya rudolph, tim meadows, karan brar, paris berelc, noah schnapp, china anne mcclain, and michael chiklis. But halloween still dominates the month of october, and as more streaming services get in on the act, the more horror movies there are to watch. Hubie halloween was released in 2020 on wednesday, october 7, 2020 (netflix release). Originally scheduled for release on october 16 2020, the film was put on the shelf due to wuhan coronavirus and all movie theaters in the world being closed.</p>

<p>Halloween day means ‘a hallowed evening’ or “all hallows’ eve”. The first film will be titled “halloween kills” and open on oct. “halloween ends” will open a year later on oct. So when it was announced that halloween 2018 would form part of a trilogy with halloween kills coming in 2020 and halloween ends to follow in 2021 we were basically ok with that. But halloween still dominates the month of october, and as more streaming services get in on the act, the more horror movies there are to watch.</p>
