<p>Halloween can be traced back to an ancient celtic holiday called samhain, celebrated in what is now ireland, scotland, and england, as well as parts of northern europe. Xd either way, it fits halloween. I find the masks more like creepy stuff that would haunt my dream tbh. The word ‘halloween’ is a contraction of ‘all hallows’ evening’, referring to the evening before the christian feast of all saints’ (hallows’) day, which dates back as far as the eighth century or even earlier! Thematically, this event is a very weird fit for halloween.</p>

<p>But is this really what halloween is all about? The word ‘halloween’ is a contraction of ‘all hallows’ evening’, referring to the evening before the christian feast of all saints’ (hallows’) day, which dates back as far as the eighth century or even earlier! Halloween is the season which owes its roots to ancient irish customs and beliefs. The day marked “the turning of the year,” noted bannatyme, author of halloween nation. When most of us think about halloween, thoughts of witches with long, warty noses, black cats and broomsticks, and the worship of satan pop into our minds.</p>

<p>Halloween can be traced back to an ancient celtic holiday called samhain, celebrated in what is now ireland, scotland, and england, as well as parts of northern europe. Fortunately, there are some easy ways for parents to keep their children safe while they are out having fun. Posted on october 24, 2020 by adunsige. It is the season of witches and vampires in which we celebrate all things spooky by eating too much candy and curling up under blankets to watch horror movies in the dark. These creatures have long been associated with the evil spirit world.</p>
