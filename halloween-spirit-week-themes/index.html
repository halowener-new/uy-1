<p>Spirit days can be fun scattered throughout the year or all in one week. Practice social distancing this spirit week! July 16 in general @beintehaa @hatterx came up with the idea for the two weeks leading up to halloween day, doing a group dress up. This should be lots of fun!

<p>Next week is virtual spirit week! If you�re in charge of this year�s school spirit week, you�re facing a challenge. Spirit week is a week in the school calendar, usually leading up to the homecoming football game, which is an opportunity to promote community and school spirit. In anticipation of halloween, the upper elementary school is celebrating “halloween spirit week” the week of october 26. Send out invitations in the shape of a ufo and set up your house with unidentified (flying or grounded) objects as well.</p>
